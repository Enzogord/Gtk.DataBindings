  this way all binary blobs are removed from svn
- Created and published simple web page
- Added first starts of layouting
- Specified milestone 0.6 in TODO
- Added start of AutoConnect() routine to adaptors

13.11.2006 (18+, R rated)
- Initial posting to svn, afer no change and my dissapearance from irc (and whole 
  net as a matter of fact, if that explains it better, if not.... all right) without any
  kind of explanation. Probably not fair of me, but my life went other way from my 
  expectations. So this should only serve as a pointer what can go wrong simply 
  because you bought a new fancy computer

- All work was stopped because life turned upside down for me to the
  level where even "Les Mis√©rables" could be called "The really happy ones". I'm
  still waiting for Victor Hugo to raise from the dead and rename his work.

  Bad things started with me buying new computer, which led to strange things
  happening on my coding desktop. Main problem was probably the reason that 
  machine had too much of ram and so it worked flawlesly for quite a long 
  time before errors started poping up.
  That was my last irc session on #mono channel, where I was asking what would some 
  development error mean. I started getting weird environment problems, compile errors
  for no reason, without explanation??? I was simply getting messages like 
  "This should't happen'". Yeah, I like that. WHAT? WHAT SHOULDN'T HAPPEN'?

  Main problem (as I discovered it later when I was doing forensic like recovery) was that 
  first time errors showed up during my regular update of my system which screwed 
  complete development environment, but to be even worse they showed during backing up data
  too. But from here let me just get to the points

  - new machine saw more service than any other machine so far, but nothing 
    seemed to work, everytime machine got back it just led to errors after 4-8 hours and
    me bitchin' on service again
  - my hdd partition got fucked up during fsck
  - backups done in that time were also fucked up (also corrupted my bread and butter projects)
    which made impossible to migrate development on other machine. You simply can't migrate if 
    you don't have anything to migrate
  - which made me really angry
  - got a bit drunk and had a little car crash where I hurt my hands for next 3-4 weeks,
    where I could only type with one finger (and holly shit, yes... it was a thumb) without 
    feeling pain or which was not bandaged with others (well bandage was firsst few days only,
    but pain stayed)
  - machine was finally fixed after 2-3 weeks, trouble seemed to be bad ram, but 
    service department simply never run complete pass (which can run very long on 8GB of ram)
    and it was me who discovered this fault.
    Yep, discovery was made by me and my trusty thumb (still the sole warrior on the hands of mine)
  - couldn't work and speech-to-text interfaces don't work (believe me). Could go into a lenghty 
    post about that, but it would more or less written with 18+ words (R rated)
  - by then I was so much behind my real work I didn't know where to turn first,
    so this project suffered. With few larger interventions at my customers
  - I somehow succedded to restore my non-commercial projects during my free time,
    which was more no time than any, and beside that I had to salvage my bread and butter
    projects first
  - slowly restored file by file from my corrupted snapshots started to come alive
    and if it wasn't my habit to change drive I'm backing on every two months (and 
    put it in the closet, where current and last were screwed, god forbid, the last backup 
    I made on that drive before putting it into closet was with my new machine, and it 
    resulted in completely screwed diff data) I probably still wouldn't restore my data

  So my lessons here are (and they are learned THE hard way):
  - if you buy new machine, don't replace your trusty desktop for at least one month of 
    terrile testing. I did that in the same minute, by simply taking my hard drive and
    putting it into new machine.
  - run ram test for at least one week before you say it is ok
  - DO NOT USE NEW MACHINE FOR BACKUP, EVEN IF BACKUP DRIVE IS EXTERNAL DRIVE
  - do not get drunk out of simple anger, your hands can suffer consequences
  - forget about speech-to-text, you'll just lose valuable time, nerves and energy.
    IT DOESN'T WORK!!! No,... on OSX or Windows either. Tried that ones too.
  - KEEP BACKUP on dedicated and terrile HW checked external server beside the same
    internal server, with complete snapshots untouched, diffs mean shit when you
    don't have complete history
  - do not register sourceforge project the day you changed machine, up until now 
    the only thing project was doing was waiting for something to be uploaded, and 
    project just feels as dead one, which it wouldn't be if life would go my way
  - No, you can't type even 2kps with one single thumb. That is something like getting to
    lightspeed with your car.

  Good things about this experience?
  - Well, since I doubt life could go for worster than this, I know now what to expect.
    "Next time, god, if you're listening... give me cancer like every other normal person and keep
    your faulty hardware troubles for others"
  - Perfect hourly/daily/weekly/monthly snapshot backup system, with check methods to see 
    if data is like it should be (Part of it will be posted as separate project after I find 
    the time to finish management console and service client status). Code should
    look like code, not like binary clusterfuck like it looked on my backups. Yep, checking is 
    done according to mime types
  - Life is finally resuming its course and one could hardly know how good ordinary office day 
    can feel until he would went trough what I went
  - One could say I'm changed, more loosed up and happier with life. It is the same relieve as
    you feel when dentist appointment is finally over, except mine was lasting for 5 1/2 months

  So what does this means? I still can't dedicate full time to this project, but I can 
  at least post it on sourceforge and fix problems which might come when using it. This
  posting just meant I'm finally getting past and present into real time.

  Advances according to my plans will be started in week or two

  p.s. If anyone feels it is not right to use words like "fuck" or "screw" in public project, he can 
       stick it. I doubt he could go without if he went trough what I went. This changelog is simply
       R rated for the reason
