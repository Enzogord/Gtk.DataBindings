Gtk.Databindings v0.98
======================

DONE
====
- All controls mostly done (at least those I've been testing)
- Moved separation plan initially for 2.0 into this release.
	- Bindings code is now in System.Data.Bindings and doesn't
	  depend on Gtk anymore. gtk-databind-lib is now pure example
	  how to extend any framework with DataBindings. All that is 
	  needed is subclassing Adaptor and ControlAdaptor and that 
	  is it.
- All controls have now:
	- bool InheritedDataSource
	- object DataSource
	- string Mappings
	- bool InheritedBoundaryDataSource
	- object BoundaryDataSource
	- string BoundaryMappings
- Pointer like Adaptors
- User data assigning events
- Using library in stetic
- Most of the help for Monodoc (have to correct XML errors)
- Object change notifications
- 5 samples. More yet to come

NOT YET REALLY TESTED
=====================
- Boundary mappings. Should work (or they did before separation). 
  I just didn't have time to test them after that.

KNOWN BUGS 
==========
(happened during cleaning session and Adapter separation):
- Controls without being on at least one DataXXXXCONTAINER can't resolve value
  easy fix with putting them on one. 
	***Will be solved ASAP.

- Containers have one box unusable in stetic. But this is stetic bug, so I can't
  do a lot about it. Workaround is to skip first dead cell on design and gtk will
  hide it in runtime anyway because it is empty. 
	***Solved when stetic corrects it

SHOWSTOPPERS BEFORE 1.0
=======================
- Error with non-assigning widgets
- More bug testing
- Provide rpm specs
- Documentation

QUICK PLAN CHANGE for 1.2
=========================
- Speed up notifications with skipping and better caching if possible
